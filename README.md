# Password Generator Starter Code

Challenge 3

Create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected.

Objective: 
The application must create a randomly generated password that meets certein criteria: 

 Must have:

- When a button is clicked generate a password.
 - For the password to be generated a series of prompts need to appear:
    - Length of at least 8 but no more than 128 characters.
    - Choose between lowercase, uppercase, numeric and/or special characters.
 - When the selection is made it should be validated and included in the password at least once.
 - When the password is generated it needs to be displayed in an alert or written on the page.

Things added:

    1. Added script to determine user selections for characters desired in the password.
    2. If initial input is not a number between 8 - 128 it will prompt the user to enter correct value.
    3. The cancel button on the prompt window will exit the applications.
    4. Used arrays and random # generator to select from the choices made by the user.
